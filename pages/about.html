        <h3>Arkivist.org, the home of blockchain backed archive data.</h3>
        <p>The mission of Arkivist.org is to create an archive of literature and other media on the blockchain in order to preserve it forever.</p>

            <h3>
                What is Arkivist.org?
            </h3>
            <p>
               Arkivist is a play on the word archive, but it also serves as an ark for data.
               <br>
               It is an ark designed to leverage block chain to save information in a decentralized, immutible format. 
               <br>
               Why does this matter? In my time we are currently "burning" books via censorship and centralized control.
               <br>
               Many people have been silenced because they present ideas that are not approved by the tech oligarchy class.
               <br>
               This site is a hybrid approach to centralized and decentralized storage.            
            </p>
            <h3>
                What are the advantages of using block chain such as what Arkivist does?
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Immutible = can never be changed.</li>
                <li>Blockchain is forever.</li>
                <li>Decentralized. No single point to be shut down.</li>                
                <li>Arkivist uses the Ether-1 blockchain.</li>                
            </ul>
